Question 1:
Read the Brooklyn College academic integrity guidelines, and write a 
statement attesting to the fact that you read, understood and agree to all 
of it.

Question 2:
In a loop, read radiuses from a user. Calculate the area of a circle using 
the formula PI*r^2. Use the pow function, and the PI constant in the Math 
class. Pick your data types wisely. Exit when the user presses ^d. Show 
your output.

Question 3:
Write a program that randomly generates an integer between 1 & 12, and 
displays the English name of that month. Run the program & show the 
output.

Question 4:
Feed a file that contains numbers into your program using command line 
redirection. Have your program read & print the file on the screen.

Question 5:
Write a program that reads three 2D points A, B, and C from the user. 
Next, calculate the length of each side of the triangle using the 
distance formula: sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2). Finally, determine if it's a 
real triangle. For a triangle to be real, the sum of any two sides needs 
to be greater than the third. Make sure your output has some real and at 
least one fake triangle.

Question 6: 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center coordinates and 
radiuses of two circles. Determine whether the circles are separate from 
each other, touching each other, overlapping each other, or completely 
within one another. Test each case and show the output.
