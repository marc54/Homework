Note: Use System.out.printf for the first two questions. That'll make 
formatting easier.

Question 1:
Write a program that asks the user how tall of a pyramid do they want to 
display on the screen, and then displays the pyramid that counts up on the 
left, and counts down on the right. For eg, if the user enters 4, the 
program shows:

        1
      1 2 1
    1 2 3 2 1
  1 2 3 4 3 2 1
  
Question 2:
Write a program that displays a calendar on the screen. It asks the user 
the year, what day the first of January fell on, then displays every month 
from January to December. Make sure to get the leap years right. Your 
months should resemble the following format:

   February 2015      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  
 8  9 10 11 12 13 14  
15 16 17 18 19 20 21  
22 23 24 25 26 27 28 

Question 3:
Write a program to check whether a string is a palindrome (a string that's 
the same forward and backwards, for eg, madamimadam)

Question 4:
Write a program that breaks out of nested loops using labels.

Question 5:
Change Scanner's delimiter, and tokenize comma separated values entered by 
the keyboard.

Question 6:
Your job is to tokenize individual characters. Your code looks like:

Scanner in = ...
in.useDelimiter()

while(in.hasNext()){
	print the current token.
}

What delimiter should you use here?
